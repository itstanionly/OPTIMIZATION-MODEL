# üíº Task 4: Business Optimization using Linear Programming (PuLP)

This project is part of the CodTech Data Science Internship Task 4, which focuses on solving a real-world business problem using **optimization techniques**. The goal is to **maximize profit** by using **Linear Programming (LP)** to determine the best production strategy given limited resources. The problem is implemented and solved using Python and the **PuLP** optimization library in a Google Colab notebook.

## üìå Problem Statement

A manufacturing company produces two products: **Chairs** and **Tables**. Each product requires different amounts of two limited resources: **labor hours** and **wood units**. Each unit of Chair and Table also brings in a different amount of profit. The aim is to **maximize total profit** without exceeding the available resources.

### Given:
| Resource | Chair Usage | Table Usage | Available |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Labor    | 3 hours     | 4 hours     | 240 hours |
| Wood     | 5 units     | 7 units     | 350 units |
| Profit   | ‚Çπ200        | ‚Çπ300        | -         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Google Colab** ‚Äì for writing, testing, and running Python code in the cloud.
- **Python 3** ‚Äì the core programming language used.
- **PuLP** ‚Äì a Linear Programming library for defining and solving optimization problems.
- **Markdown** ‚Äì for documentation and explanations inside the notebook.

---

## ‚úÖ Steps Followed

1. **Problem definition** and explanation using code comments and markdown.
2. **Decision variable setup**: Number of chairs and tables to produce.
3. **Objective function**: Maximize profit.
4. **Constraints added**: Labor and wood usage should not exceed the limits.
5. **Model solved** using PuLP's solver.
6. **Results printed** showing optimal production values and maximum profit.
7. **Insights explained** in terms of business decision-making.

---

## üìä Output Summary

- ‚úÖ **Optimal Solution**:
  - Chairs to produce: `0`
  - Tables to produce: `50`
- ‚úÖ **Maximum Profit**: ‚Çπ15,000

This means, under current constraints, producing only **tables** yields the highest profit.
